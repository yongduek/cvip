    "# Camera Pose: Perspective n Point Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective-n-Point**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perspective-n-Point [1] is the problem of estimating the pose of a calibrated camera given a set of n 3D points in the world and their corresponding 2D projections in the image. \n",
    "- The camera pose consists of 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) which are made up of the rotation (roll, pitch, and yaw) and 3D translation of the camera with respect to the world. \n",
    "- This problem originates from camera calibration and has many applications in computer vision and other areas, including 3D pose estimation, robotics and augmented reality.[2] \n",
    "- A commonly used solution to the problem exists for n = 3 called P3P, and many solutions are available for the general case of n ≥ 3. \n",
    "- A solution for n = 2 exists if feature orientations are available at the two points.[3] \n",
    "- Implementations of these solutions are also available in open source software: OpenCV\n",
